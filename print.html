<p>Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be
implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.</p>
<p>Some changes though are &quot;substantial&quot;, and we ask that these be put through a
bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the Rust and WebAssembly
community.</p>
<p>The &quot;RFC&quot; (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and
controlled path for substantial changes and additions to enter the Rust and
WebAssembly ecosystem, so that all stakeholders can be confident about the
direction the ecosystem is evolving in.</p>

<a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary"><h1>Summary</h1></a>
<p>Adopt a simplified version of the Rust RFC process to the Rust and WebAssembly
domain working group. The RFC process will provide a single place to decide on
substantial changes and additions across the ecosystem for all stakeholders.</p>
<a class="header" href="#motivation" id="motivation"><h1>Motivation</h1></a>
<p>There are some decisions which have broad impact across the Rust and WebAssembly
ecosystem, and therefore have many stakeholders who deserve to have a say in the
decision and provide feedback on proposals and designs. Right now, these
decisions tend to be made in whatever local repository pull request or issue
tracker. This makes it difficult for stakeholders to stay on top of these
decisions, because they need to watch many different places. For a repository
owner or team, it is also difficult to determine whether the ecosystem is in
favor of a feature or not.</p>
<p>After adopting this RFC process, stakeholders should have an easier time staying
on top of substantial changes and features within the ecosystem. Additionally,
the maintainers of a particular repository within the Rust and WebAssembly
ecosystem should feel confident that they've solicited feedback from everyone
involved after going through an RFC, and won't get angry bug reports from users
who felt that they were not consulted. Everyone should have shared confidence in
the direction that the ecosystem evolves in.</p>
<a class="header" href="#detailed-explanation" id="detailed-explanation"><h1>Detailed Explanation</h1></a>
<p>Right now, governance for repositories within the <code>rustwasm</code> organization
<a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/team/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#repositories">follow these rules</a> describing policy for merging pull
requests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, each <code>rustwasm/*</code> repository has the following general
policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All pull requests must be reviewed and approved of by at least one relevant
team member or repository collaborator before merging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Larger, more nuanced decisions about design, architecture, breaking changes,
trade offs, etc are made by the relevant team and/or repository
collaborators consensus. In other words, decisions on things that aren't
straightforward improvements to or bug fixes for things that already exist
in the project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This policy categorizes pull requests as either &quot;larger, more nuanced ...&quot;
changes or not (we will use &quot;substantial&quot; from now on). When a change is not
substantial, it requires only a single team member approve of it. When a change
is larger and more substantial, then the relevant team comes to consensus on how
to proceed.</p>
<p>This RFC intends to further sub-categorize substantial changes into those that
affect only maintenance of the repository itself, and are therefore only
substantial <em>internally</em> to the maintainers, versus those substantial changes
that have an impact on <em>external</em> users and the larger Rust and WebAssembly
community. For internally substantial changes, we do not intend to change the
current policy at all. For substantial changes that have external impact, we
will adopt a lightweight version of Rust's RFC process.</p>
<a class="header" href="#when-does-a-change-need-an-rfc" id="when-does-a-change-need-an-rfc"><h2>When does a change need an RFC?</h2></a>
<p>You need to follow the RFC process if you intend to make externally substantial
changes to any repository within the <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm"><code>rustwasm</code> organization</a>, or the RFC
process itself. What constitutes a &quot;substantial&quot; change is evolving based on
community norms and varies depending on what part of the ecosystem you are
proposing to change, but may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The removal of or breaking changes to public APIs in widespread use.</li>
<li>Public API additions that extend the public API in new ways (i.e. more than
&quot;we implement <code>SomeTrait</code> for <code>ThisThing</code>, so also implement <code>SomeTrait</code> for
<code>RelatedThing</code>&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some changes do not require an RFC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rephrasing, reorganizing, refactoring, or otherwise &quot;changing shape does
not change meaning&quot;.</li>
<li>Additions that strictly improve objective, numerical quality criteria
(warning removal, speedup, better platform coverage, more parallelism, trap
more errors, etc.)</li>
<li>Additions only likely to be <em>noticed by</em> other maintainers, and remain
invisible to users.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you submit a pull request to implement a new feature without going through
the RFC process, it may be closed with a polite request to submit an RFC first.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-rfc-process-step-by-step" id="the-rfc-process-step-by-step"><h2>The RFC process step by step</h2></a>
<ul>
<li>Fork the <a href="http://github.com/rustwasm/rfcs">RFC repository</a>.</li>
<li>Copy <code>000-template.md</code> to <code>text/000-my-feature.md</code> (where &quot;my-feature&quot; is
descriptive. Don't assign an RFC number yet).</li>
<li>Fill in the RFC. Put care into the details: RFCs that do not present
convincing motivation, demonstrate understanding of the impact of the design,
or are disingenuous about the drawbacks or alternatives tend to be
poorly-received.</li>
<li>Submit a pull request. As a pull request, the RFC will receive design feedback
from the larger community, and the author should be prepared to revise it in
response.</li>
<li>Each new RFC pull request will be triaged in the next Rust and WebAssembly
domain working group meeting and assigned to one or more of the <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/team/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#teams"><code>@rustwasm/*</code>
teams</a>.</li>
<li>Build consensus and integrate feedback. RFCs that have broad support are
much more likely to make progress than those that don't receive any
comments. Feel free to reach out to the RFC assignee in particular to get
help identifying stakeholders and obstacles.</li>
<li>The team(s) will discuss the RFC pull request, as much as possible in the
comment thread of the pull request itself. Offline discussion will be
summarized on the pull request comment thread.</li>
<li>RFCs rarely go through this process unchanged, especially as alternatives
and drawbacks are shown. You can make edits, big and small, to the RFC to
clarify or change the design, but make changes as new commits to the pull
request, and leave a comment on the pull request explaining your changes.
Specifically, do not squash or rebase commits after they are visible on the
pull request.</li>
<li>At some point, a member of the subteam will propose a &quot;motion for final
comment period&quot; (FCP), along with a <em>disposition</em> for the RFC (merge, close,
or postpone).
<ul>
<li>This step is taken when enough of the tradeoffs have been discussed that the
team(s) are in a position to make a decision. That does not require
consensus amongst all participants in the RFC thread (which may be
impossible). However, the argument supporting the disposition on the RFC
needs to have already been clearly articulated, and there should not be a
strong consensus <em>against</em> that position outside of the team(s). Team
members use their best judgment in taking this step, and the FCP itself
ensures there is ample time and notification for stakeholders to push back
if it is made prematurely.</li>
<li>For RFCs with lengthy discussion, the motion to FCP should be preceded by a
<em>summary comment</em> trying to lay out the current state of the discussion and
major tradeoffs/points of disagreement.</li>
<li>Before actually entering FCP, <em>all</em> members of the team(s) must sign off;
this is often the point at which many team members first review the RFC in
full depth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The FCP lasts seven calendar days. It is also advertised widely, e.g. in an
issue of <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/">&quot;This Week in Rust and WebAssembly&quot; on the Rust and WebAssembly
blog</a>. This way all stakeholders have a chance to
lodge any final objections before a decision is reached.</li>
<li>In most cases, the FCP period is quiet, and the RFC is either merged or
closed. However, sometimes substantial new arguments or ideas are raised,
the FCP is canceled, and the RFC goes back into development mode.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#from-rfc-to-implementation" id="from-rfc-to-implementation"><h2>From RFC to implementation</h2></a>
<p>Once an RFC is merged it becomes &quot;active&quot; then authors may implement it and
submit the feature as a pull request to the relevant repositories. Being
&quot;active&quot; is not a rubber stamp, and in particular still does not mean the
feature will ultimately be merged; it does mean that in principle all the major
stakeholders have agreed to the feature and are amenable to merging it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fact that a given RFC has been accepted and is &quot;active&quot; implies
nothing about what priority is assigned to its implementation, nor does it imply
anything about whether a developer has been assigned the task of implementing
the feature. While it is not <em>necessary</em> that the author of the RFC also write
the implementation, it is by far the most effective way to see an RFC through to
completion: authors should not expect that other project developers will take on
responsibility for implementing their accepted feature.</p>
<p>Modifications to &quot;active&quot; RFCs can be done in follow-up pull requests. We strive
to write each RFC in a manner that it will reflect the final design of the
feature; but the nature of the process means that we cannot expect every merged
RFC to actually reflect what the end result will be at the time of the next
major release.</p>
<p>In general, once accepted, RFCs should not be substantially changed. Only very
minor changes should be submitted as amendments. More substantial changes should
be new RFCs, with a note added to the original RFC.</p>
<a class="header" href="#rationale-and-alternatives" id="rationale-and-alternatives"><h1>Rationale and Alternatives</h1></a>
<p>The design space for decision making is very large, from democratic to
autocratic and more.</p>
<p>Forking and simplifying Rust's RFC process is <em>practical</em>. Rather than designing
a decision making process from scratch, we take an existing one that works well
and tailor it to our needs. Many Rust and WebAssembly stakeholders are already
familiar with it.</p>
<p>The main differences from the Rust RFC process are:</p>
<ul>
<li>FCP lasts seven calendar days rather than ten. This reflects our desire for a
lighter-weight process that moves more quickly than Rust's RFC process.</li>
<li>The RFC template is shorter and merges together into single sections what were
distinct sections in the Rust RFC template. Again, this reflects our desire
for a lighter-weight process where we do not need to go into quite as much
painstaking detail as Rust RFCs sometimes do (perhaps excluding <em>this</em> RFC).</li>
</ul>
<p>The phases of RFC development and post-RFC implementation are largely the same
as the Rust RFC process. We found that the motivations for nearly every phase of
Rust's RFC process are equally motivating for the Rust and WebAssembly
domain. We expected to simplify phases a lot, for example, we initially
considered removing FCP and going straight to signing off on accepting an RFC or
not. However, FCP exists as a way to (1) allow stakeholders to voice any final
concerns that hadn't been brought up yet, and (2) help enforce the &quot;no new
rationale&quot; rule. Both points apply equally well to the Rust and WebAssembly
domain working group and ecosystem as they apply to Rust itself.</p>
<p>We can also avoid adopting an RFC process, and move more quickly by allowing
each repository's team or owner to be dictators of their corner of the
ecosystem. However, this will result in valuable feedback, opinions, and insight
not getting voiced, and narrow decisions being made.</p>
<a class="header" href="#unresolved-questions" id="unresolved-questions"><h1>Unresolved Questions</h1></a>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Will we use <a href="https://github.com/anp/rfcbot-rs"><code>@rfcbot</code></a>? If we can, we probably should, but this can
be decided separately from whether to accept this RFC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to best advertise new RFCs and FCP? Should we make &quot;This Week in Rust and
WebAssembly&quot; actually be weekly rather than every other week? The interaction
between FCP length and frequency of TWiRaWA posting seems important.</p>

<a class="header" href="#summary-1" id="summary-1"><h1>Summary</h1></a>
<p>Support defining single inheritance relationships in <code>wasm-bindgen</code>'s imported
types. Specifically, we define static upcasts from a derived type to one of its
base types, checked dynamic casts from a type to any other type using
JavaScript's <code>instanceof</code> operator, and finally unchecked casts between any
JavaScript types as an escape hatch for developers. For the proc-macro frontend,
this is done by adding the <code>#[wasm_bindgen(extends = Base)]</code> attribute to the
derived type. For the WebIDL frontend, WebIDL's existing interface inheritance
syntax is used.</p>
<a class="header" href="#motivation-1" id="motivation-1"><h1>Motivation</h1></a>
<p>Prototype chains and ECMAScript classes allow JavaScript developers to define
single inheritance relationships between types. <a href="https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#dfn-inherit">WebIDL interfaces can inherit
from one another,</a> and Web APIs make widespread use of this
feature. We want to support calling base methods on an imported derived type and
passing an imported derived type to imported functions that expect a base type
in <code>wasm-bindgen</code>. We want to support dynamically checking whether some JS value
is an instance of a JS class, and dynamically-checked casts. Finally, the same
way that <code>unsafe</code> provides an encapsulatable escape hatch for Rust's ownership
and borrowing, we want to provide unchecked (but safe!) conversions between JS
classes and values.</p>
<a class="header" href="#stakeholders" id="stakeholders"><h1>Stakeholders</h1></a>
<p>Anyone who is using <code>wasm-bindgen</code> directly or transitively through the
<code>web-sys</code> crate is affected. This does <em>not</em> affect the larger wasm ecosystem
outside of Rust (eg Webpack). Therefore, the usual advertisement of this RFC on
<em>This Week in Rust and WebAssembly</em> and at our working group meetings should
suffice in soliciting feedback.</p>

<p>Consider the following JavaScript class definitions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">class MyBase { }
class MyDerived extends MyBase { }
</code></pre>
<p>We translate this into <code>wasm-bindgen</code> proc-macro imports like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen]
extern {
    pub extern type MyBase;

    #[wasm_bindgen(extends = MyBase)]
    pub extern type MyDerived;
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note the <code>#[wasm_bindgen(extends = MyBase)]</code> annotation on <code>extern type MyDerived</code>. This tells <code>wasm-bindgen</code> that <code>MyDerived</code> inherits from <code>MyBase</code>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could describe these same classes as WebIDL interfaces:</p>
<pre><code class="language-webidl">interface MyBase {}
interface MyDerived : MyBase {}
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#example-upcasting" id="example-upcasting"><h3>Example Upcasting</h3></a>
<p>We can upcast into a <code>MyBase</code> from a <code>MyDerived</code> type using the normal <code>From</code>,
<code>AsRef</code>, <code>AsMut</code>, and <code>Into</code> conversions:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let derived: MyDerived = get_derived_from_somewhere();
let base: MyBase = derived.into();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="#example-dynamically-checked-casting" id="example-dynamically-checked-casting"><h3>Example Dynamically-Checked Casting</h3></a>
<p>We can do dynamically-checked (checked with JavaScript's <code>instanceof</code> operator)
downcasts from a <code>MyBase</code> into a <code>MyDerived</code> using the <code>dyn_{into,ref,mut}</code>
methods:</p>
<pre><code>let base: MyBase = get_base_from_somewhere();
match base.dyn_into::&lt;MyDerived&gt;() {
    Ok(derived) =&gt; {
        // It was an instance of `MyDerived`!
    }
    Err(base) =&gt; {
        // It was some other kind of instance of `MyBase`.
    }
}
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#example-unchecked-casting" id="example-unchecked-casting"><h3>Example Unchecked Casting</h3></a>
<p>If we really know that a <code>MyBase</code> is an instance of <code>MyDerived</code> and we don't

<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let derived: MyDerived = get_derived_from_somewhere();
let base: MyBase = derived.into();

// We know that this is a `MyDerived` since we *just* converted it into `MyBase`
// from `MyDerived` above.
let derived: MyDerived = base.unchecked_into();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Unchecked casting serves as an escape hatch for developers, and while it can
lead to JavaScript exceptions, it cannot create memory unsafety.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-jscast-trait" id="the-jscast-trait"><h2>The <code>JsCast</code> Trait</h2></a>
<p>For dynamically-checked and unchecked casting between arbitrary JavaScript
types, we introduce the <code>JsCast</code> trait. It requires implementations provide a
boolean predicate that consults JavaScript's <code>instanceof</code> operator, as well as
unchecked conversions from JavaScript values:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub trait JsCast {
    fn instanceof(val: &amp;JsValue) -&gt; bool;

    fn unchecked_from_js(val: JsValue) -&gt; Self;
    fn unchecked_from_js_ref(val: &amp;JsValue) -&gt; &amp;Self;
    fn unchecked_from_js_mut(val: &amp;mut JsValue) -&gt; &amp;mut Self;

    // ... provided methods elided ...
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><code>JsCast</code>'s required trait methods are not intended to be used to directly, but
instead are leveraged by its provided methods. Users of <code>wasm-bindgen</code> will be
able to ignore <code>JsCast</code>'s required trait methods for the most part, since the
implementations will be mechanically generated, and they will only be using the
required trait methods indirectly through the more ergonomic provided methods.</p>
<p>For every <code>extern { type Illmatic; }</code> imported with <code>wasm-bindgen</code>, we emit an
implementation of <code>JsCast</code> similar to this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
impl JsCast for Illmatic {
    fn instanceof(val: &amp;JsValue) -&gt; bool {
        #[cfg(all(target_arch = &quot;wasm32&quot;, not(target_os = &quot;emscripten&quot;)))]
        #[wasm_import_module = &quot;__wbindgen_placeholder__&quot;]
        extern {
            fn __wbindgen_instanceof_Illmatic(idx: u32) -&gt; u32;
        }

        #[cfg(not(all(target_arch = &quot;wasm32&quot;, not(target_os = &quot;emscripten&quot;))))]
        unsafe extern fn __wbindgen_instanceof_Illmatic(_: u32) -&gt; u32 {
            panic!(&quot;function not implemented on non-wasm32 targets&quot;)
        }

        __wbindgen_instance_of_MyDerived(val.idx) == 1
    }

    fn unchecked_from_js(val: JsValue) -&gt; Illmatic {
        Illmatic {
            obj: val,
        }
    }

    fn unchecked_from_js_ref(val: &amp;JsValue) -&gt; &amp;Illmatic {
        unsafe {
            &amp;*(val as *const JsValue as *const Illmatic)
        }
    }

    fn unchecked_from_js_mut(val: &amp;mut JsValue) -&gt; &amp;mut Illmatic {
        unsafe {
            &amp;mut *(val as *mut JsValue as *mut Illmatic)
        }
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Additionally, <code>wasm-bindgen</code> will emit this JavaScript definition of
<code>__wbindgen_instanceof_Illmatic</code> that simply wraps the JS <code>instanceof</code> operator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const __wbindgen_instanceof_Illmatic = function (idx) {

<a class="header" href="#drawbacks" id="drawbacks"><h1>Drawbacks</h1></a>
<ul>
<li>We might accidentally <em>encourage</em> using this inheritance instead of the more
Rust-idiomatic usage of traits.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#rationale-and-alternatives-1" id="rationale-and-alternatives-1"><h1>Rationale and Alternatives</h1></a>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We could define an <code>Upcast</code> trait instead of using the standard <code>From</code> and
<code>As{Ref,Mut}</code> traits. This would make it more clear that we are doing
inheritance-related casts, but would also be a new trait that folks would have
to understand vs pretty much every Rust programmer's familiarity with the
<code>std</code> traits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upcasting using the <code>From</code> and <code>As{Ref,Mut}</code> traits does not provide
chainable, turbofishing methods on <code>self</code> that one could use when type
inference needs a helping hand. Instead, one must create a local variable with
an explicit type.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
// Can't do this with upcasting.
get_some_js_type()
  .into::&lt;AnotherJsType&gt;()
  .method();

// Have to do this:
let another: AnotherJsType = get_some_js_type().into();
another.method();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>If we used a custom <code>Upcast</code> trait, we could provide turbofishable methods on
<code>self</code>, at the cost of using non-standard traits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could use <code>TryFrom</code> for dynamically-checked casts instead of
<code>JsCast::dyn_into</code> et al. This would introduce a new nightly feature
requirement when using <code>wasm-bindgen</code>. We leave the possibility open for when
<code>TryFrom</code> is stabilized by not naming our dynamically-checked cast methods
<code>JsCast::try_into</code> to be future compatible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explicit upcasting still does not provide very good ergonomics. There are a
couple things we could do here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use the <code>Deref</code> trait to hide upcasting. This is generally <a href="https://github.com/rust-unofficial/patterns/blob/master/anti_patterns/deref.md">considered an
anti-pattern</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatically create a <code>MyBaseMethods</code> trait for base types that contain all
the base type's methods and implement that trait for <code>MyBase</code> and
<code>MyDerived</code>? Also emit a <code>MyDerivedMethods</code> trait that requires <code>MyBase</code> as
a super trait, representing the inheritance at the trait level? This is the
Rust-y thing to do and allows us to write generic functions with trait
bounds. This is what <code>stdweb</code> does with the <code>IHTMLElement</code> trait for
<code>HTMLElement</code>'s methods.</p>
<p>Whether we do this or not also happens to be orthogonal to casting between
base and derived types. We leave exploring this design space to follow up
RFCs, and hope to land just the casting in an incremental fashion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traits sometimes get in the way of learning what one can do with a thing. They
aren't as up-front in the generated documentation, and can lead people to
thinking they <em>must</em> write code that is generic over a trait when it isn't
necessary. There are two ways we could get rid of the <code>JsCast</code> trait:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Only implement its methods on <code>JsValue</code> and require that conversions like
<code>ImportedJsClassUno</code> -&gt; <code>ImportedJsClassDos</code> go to <code>JsValue</code> in between:
<code>ImportedJsClassUno</code> -&gt; <code>JsValue</code> -&gt; <code>ImpiortedJsClassDos</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could redundantly implement all its methods on <code>JsValue</code> and imported JS
classes directly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unchecked casting could be marked <code>unsafe</code> to reflect that correctness relies
on the programmer in these cases. However, misusing unchecked JS casts cannot
introduce memory unsafety in the Rust sense, so this would be using <code>unsafe</code>
as a general-purpose &quot;you probably shouldn't use this&quot; warning, which is not
<code>unsafe</code>'s intended purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could only implement unchecked casts for everything all the time. This
would encourage a loose, shoot-from-the-hip programming style. We would prefer
leveraging types when possible. We realize that escape hatches are still
required at times, and we do provide arbitrary unchecked casts, but guide
folks towards upcasting with <code>From</code>, <code>AsRef</code>, and <code>AsMut</code> and doing
dynamically checks for other types of casts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#unresolved-questions-1" id="unresolved-questions-1"><h1>Unresolved Questions</h1></a>
<ul>
<li>Should the <code>JsCast</code> trait be re-exported in <code>wasm_bindgen::prelude</code>? We do not
specify that it should be in this RFC, and we can initially ship without
re-exporting it in prelude and see what it feels like. Based on experience, we
may decide in the future to add it to the prelude.</li>

<p>Change <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> to use <code>structural</code> by default, and add a new
attribute <code>final</code> for an opt-in to today's behavior. Once implemented then use
<code>Deref</code> to model the class inheritance hierarchy in <code>web-sys</code> and <code>js-sys</code> to
enable ergonomic usage of superclass methods of web types.</p>
<a class="header" href="#motivation-2" id="motivation-2"><h1>Motivation</h1></a>
<p>The initial motivation for this is outlined <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/rfcs/pull/3">RFC 3</a>, namely that the <code>web-sys</code>
crate provides bindings for many APIs found on the web but accessing the
functionality of parent classes is quite cumbersome.</p>
<p>The web makes extensive use of class inheritance hierarchies, and in <code>web-sys</code>
right now each class gets its own <code>struct</code> type with inherent methods. These
types implement <code>AsRef</code> between one another for subclass relationships, but it's
quite unergonomic to actually reference the functionality! For example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let x: &amp;Element = ...;
let y: &amp;Node = x.as_ref();
y.append_child(...);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>or...</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let x: &amp;Element = ...;
&lt;Element as AsRef&lt;Node&gt;&gt;::as_ref(x)
    .append_child(...);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>It's be much nicer if we could support this in a more first-class fashion and
make it more ergonomic!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: While this RFC has the same motivation as <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/rfcs/pull/3">RFC 3</a> it's proposing an
alternative solution, specifically enabled by switching by <code>structural</code> by
default, which is discussed in <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/rfcs/pull/3">RFC 3</a> but is hopefully formally outlined
here.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="#detailed-explanation-2" id="detailed-explanation-2"><h1>Detailed Explanation</h1></a>
<p>This RFC proposes using the built-in <code>Deref</code> trait to model the class hierarchy
found on the web in <code>web-sys</code>. This also proposes changes to <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code>
to make using <code>Deref</code> feasible for binding arbitrary JS apis (such as those on
NPM) with <code>Deref</code> as well.</p>
<p>For example, <code>web-sys</code> will contain:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
impl Deref for Element {
    type Target = Node;

    fn deref(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;Node { /* ... */ }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>allowing us to write our example above as:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let x: &amp;Element = ...;
x.append_child(...); // implicit deref to `Node`!
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>All JS types in <code>web-sys</code> and in general have at most one superclass. Currently,
however, the <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> attribute allows specifying multiple <code>extends</code>
attributes to indicate superclasses:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen]
extern {
    #[wasm_bindgen(extends = Node, extends = Object)]
    type Element;

    // ...
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>web-sys</code> API generator currently lists an <code>extends</code> for all superclasses,
transitively. This is then used in the code generator to generate <code>AsRef</code>
implementatiosn for <code>Element</code>.</p>
<p>The code generation of <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> will be updated with the following
rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>If no <code>extends</code> attribute is present, defined types will implement
<code>Deref&lt;Target=JsValue&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the <em>first</em> <code>extends</code> attribute is used to implement
<code>Deref&lt;Target=ListedType&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>(long term, currently require a breaking change) reject multiple <code>extends</code>
attributes, requiring there's only one.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that <code>web-sys</code> may need to be updated to ensure that the immediate
superclass is listed first in <code>extends</code>. Manual bindings will continue to work
and will have the old <code>AsRef</code> implementations as well as a new <code>Deref</code>
implementation.</p>
<p>The <code>Deref</code> implementation will concretely be implemented as:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">

<a class="header" href="#switching-to-structural-by-default" id="switching-to-structural-by-default"><h3>Switching to <code>structural</code> by default</h3></a>
<p>If we were to implement the above <code>Deref</code> proposal as-is today in
<code>wasm-bindgen</code>, it would have a crucial drawback. It may not handle inheritance
correctly! Let's explore this with an example. Say we have some JS we'd like to
import:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">class Parent {
    constructor() {}
    method() { console.log('parent'); }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    constructor() {}
    method() { console.log('child'); }
}
</code></pre>
<p>we would then bind this in Rust with:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen]
extern {
    type Parent;
    #[wasm_bindgen(constructor)]
    fn new() -&gt; Parent;
    #[wasm_bindgen(method)]
    fn method(this: &amp;Parent);

    #[wasm_bindgen(extends = Parent)]
    type Child;
    #[wasm_bindgen(constructor)]
    fn new() -&gt; Child;
    #[wasm_bindgen(method)]
    fn method(this: &amp;Child);
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>and we could then use it like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn run() {
    let parent = Parent::new();
    parent.method();
    let child = Child::new();
    child.method();
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>and we would today see <code>parent</code> and <code>child</code> logged to the console. Ok everything
is working as expected so far! We know we've got <code>Deref&lt;Target=Parent&gt; for Child</code>, though, so let's say we tweak this example a bit:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn run() {
    call_method(&amp;Parent::new());
    call_method(&amp;Child::new());
}

fn call_method(object: &amp;Parent) {
    object.method();
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Here we'd naively (and correctly) expect <code>parent</code> and <code>child</code> to be output like
before, but much to our surprise this actually prints out <code>parent</code> twice!</p>
<p>The issue with this is how <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> treats method calls today. When you
say:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen(method)]
fn method(this: &amp;Parent);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>then <code>wasm-bindgen</code> (the CLI tool) generates JS that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const Parent_method_target = Parent.prototype.method;

export function __wasm_bindgen_Parent_method(obj) {
    Parent_method_target.call(getObject(obj));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here we can see that, by default, <code>wasm-bindgen</code> is <strong>reaching into the
<code>prototype</code> of each class to figure out what method to call</strong>. This in turn
means that when <code>Parent::method</code> is called in Rust, it unconditionally uses the
method defined on <code>Parent</code> rather than walking the protype chain (that JS
usually does) to find the right <code>method</code> method.</p>
<p>To improve the situation there's a <code>structural</code> attribute to wasm-bindgen to fix
this, which when applied like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen(method, structural)]
fn method(this: &amp;Parent);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>means that the following JS code is generated:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const Parent_method_target = function() { this.method(); };

// ...
</code></pre>
<p>Here we can see that a JS function shim is generated instead of using the raw
function value in the prototype. This, however, means that our example above
will indeed print <code>parent</code> and then <code>child</code> because JS is using prototype
lookups to find the <code>method</code> method.</p>
<p>Phew! Ok with all that information, we can see that <strong>if <code>structural</code> is omitted
then JS class hierarchies can be subtly incorrect when methods taking parent
classes are passed child classes which override methods</strong>.</p>
<p>An easy solution to this problem is to simply use <code>structural</code> everywhere, so...
let's propose that! Consequently, this RFC proposes changing <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code>
to act as if all bindings are labeled as <code>structural</code>. While technically a
breaking change it's believed that we don't have any usage which would actually
run into the breakage here.</p>
<a class="header" href="#adding-wasm_bindgenfinal" id="adding-wasm_bindgenfinal"><h3>Adding <code>#[wasm_bindgen(final)]</code></h3></a>
<p>Since <code>structural</code> is not the default today we don't actually have a name for
the default behavior of <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> today. This RFC proposes adding a new
attribute to <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code>, <code>final</code>, which indicates that it should have
today's behavior.</p>
<p>When attached to an attribute or method, the <code>final</code> attribute indicates that
the method or attribute should be processed through the <code>prototype</code> of a class
rather than looked up structurally via the prototype chain.</p>
<p>You can think of this as &quot;everything today is <code>final</code> by default&quot;.</p>
<a class="header" href="#why-is-it-ok-to-make-structural-the-default" id="why-is-it-ok-to-make-structural-the-default"><h3>Why is it ok to make <code>structural</code> the default?</h3></a>
<p>One pretty reasonable question you might have at this point is &quot;why, if
<code>structural</code> is the default today, is it ok to switch?&quot; To answer this, let's
first explore why <code>final</code> is the default today!</p>
<p>From its inception <code>wasm-bindgen</code> has been designed with the future <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/host-bindings">host
bindings</a> proposal for WebAssembly. The host bindings proposal promises
faster-than-JS DOM access by removing many of the dynamic checks necessary when
calling DOM methods. This proposal, however, is still in relatively early stages
and hasn't been implemented in any browser yet (as far as we know).</p>
<p>In WebAssembly on the web all imported functions must be plain old JS functions.
They're all currently invoked with <code>undefined</code> as the <code>this</code> parameter. With
host bindings, however, there's a way to say that an imported function uses the
first argument to the function as the <code>this</code> parameter (like <code>Function.call</code> in
JS). This in turn brings the promise of <em>eliminating any shim functions
necessary when calling imported functionality</em>.</p>
<p>As an example, today for <code>#[wasm_bindgen(method)] fn parent(this: &amp;Parent);</code> we
generate JS that looks like:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen(method)]
fn method(this: &amp;Parent);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>means that the following JS code is generated:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const Parent_method_target = Parent.prototype.method;

export function __wasm_bindgen_Parent_method(idx) {
    Parent_method_target.call(getObject(idx));
}
</code></pre>
<p>If we assume for a moment that <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types"><code>anyref</code> is implemented</a> we
could instead change this to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const Parent_method_target = Parent.prototype.method;

export function __wasm_bindgen_Parent_method(obj) {
    Parent_method_target.call(obj);
}
</code></pre>
<p>(note the lack of need for <code>getObject</code>). And finally, with <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/host-bindings">host bindings</a> we
can say that the wasm module's import of <code>__wasm_bindgen_Parent_method</code> uses the
first parameter as <code>this</code>, meaning we can transform this to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export const __wasm_bindgen_Parent_method = Parent.prototype.method;
</code></pre>
<p>and <em>voila</em>, no JS function shims necessary! With <code>structural</code> we'll still need
a function shim in this future world:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export const __wasm_bindgen_Parent_method = function() { this.method(); };
</code></pre>
<p>Alright, with some of those basics out of the way, let's get back to
why-<code>final</code>-by-default. The promise of <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/host-bindings">host bindings</a> is that by eliminating
all these JS function shims necessary we can be faster than we would otherwise
be, providing a feeling that <code>final</code> is faster than <code>structural</code>. This future,
however, relies on a number of unimplemented features in wasm engines today.
Let's consequently get an idea of what the performance looks like today!</p>
<p>I've been slowly over time preparing a <a href="https://alexcrichton.github.io/rust-wasm-benchmark/">microbenchmark suite</a> for measuring
JS/wasm/wasm-bindgen performance. The interesting one here is the benchmark
&quot;<code>structural</code> vs not&quot;. If you click &quot;Run test&quot; in a browser after awhile you'll
see two bars show up. The left-hand one is a method call with <code>final</code> and the
right-hand one is a method call with <code>structural</code>. The results I see on my
computer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox 62, <code>structural</code> is 3% faster</li>
<li>Firefox 64, <code>structural</code> is 3% slower</li>
<li>Chrome 69, <code>structural</code> is 5% slower</li>
<li>Edge 42, <code>structural</code> is 22% slower</li>
<li>Safari 12, <code>strutural</code> is 17% slower</li>
</ul>
<p>So it looks like for Firefox/Chrome it's not really making much of a difference
but in Edge/Safari it's much faster to use <code>final</code>! It turns out, however, that
we're not optimizing <code>structural</code> as much as we can. Let's change our generated
code from:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const Parent_method_target = function() { this.method(); };

export function __wasm_bindgen_Parent_method(obj) {
    Parent_method_target.call(getObject(obj));
}
</code></pre>
<p>to...</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export function __wasm_bindgen_Parent_method(obj) {
    getObject(obj).method();
}
</code></pre>
<p>(manually editing the JS today)</p>
<p>and if we rerun the benchmarks (sorry no online demo) we get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox 62, <code>structural</code> is 22% faster</li>
<li>Firefox 64, <code>structural</code> is 10% faster</li>
<li>Chrome 69, <code>structural</code> is 0.3% slower</li>
<li>Edge 42, <code>structural</code> is 15% faster</li>
<li>Safai 12, <code>structural</code> is 8% slower</li>
</ul>
<p>and these numbers look quite different! There's some strong data here showing
that <code>final</code> <em>is not universally faster today</em> and is actually almost
universally slower (when we optimize <code>structural</code> slightly).</p>
<p>Ok! That's all basically a very long winded way of saying <strong><code>final</code> was the
historical default because we thought it was faster, but it turns out that in JS
engines today it isn't always faster</strong>. As a result, this RFC proposes that it's
ok to make <code>structural</code> the default.</p>
<a class="header" href="#drawbacks-1" id="drawbacks-1"><h1>Drawbacks</h1></a>
<p><code>Deref</code> is a somewhat quiet trait with disproportionately large ramifications.
It affects method resolution (the <code>.</code> operator) as well as coercions (<code>&amp;T</code> to
<code>&amp;U</code>). Discovering this in <code>web-sys</code> and/or JS apis in the ecosystem isn't
always the easiest thing to do. It's thought, though, that this aspect of
<code>Deref</code> won't come up very often when using JS apis in practice. Instead most
APIs will work &quot;as-is&quot; as you might expect in JS in Rust as well, with <code>Deref</code>
being an unobtrusive solution for developers to mostly ignore it an just call
methods.</p>
<p>Additionally <code>Deref</code> has the drawback that it's not explicitly designed for
class inheritance hierarchies. For example <code>*element</code> produces a <code>Node</code>,
<code>**element</code> produces an <code>Object</code>, etc. This is expected to not really come up
that much in practice, though, and instead automatic coercions will cover almost
all type conversions.</p>
<a class="header" href="#rationale-and-alternatives-2" id="rationale-and-alternatives-2"><h1>Rationale and Alternatives</h1></a>

<p>Add the ability for <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> to process, load, and handle dependencies
on local JS files.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>module</code> attribute can now be used to import files explicitly:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen(module = &quot;/js/foo.js&quot;)]
extern &quot;C&quot; {
    // ...
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>inline_js</code> attribute can now be used to import JS modules inline:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen(inline_js = &quot;export function foo() {}&quot;)]
extern &quot;C&quot; {
    fn foo();
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>--browser</code> flag is repurposed to generate an ES module for the browser
and <code>--no-modules</code> is deprecated in favor of this flag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>--nodejs</code> will not immediately support local JS snippets, but will do so
in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#motivation-3" id="motivation-3"><h1>Motivation</h1></a>
<p>The goal of <code>wasm-bindgen</code> is to enable easy interoperation between Rust and JS.
While it's very easy to write custom Rust code, it's actually pretty difficult
to write custom JS and hook it up with <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> (see
<a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/224">rustwasm/wasm-bindgen#224</a>). The <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code>
attribute currently only supports importing functions from ES modules, but even
then the support is limited and simply assumes that the ES module string exists
in the final application build step.</p>
<p>Currently there is no composable way for a crate to have some auxiliary JS that
it is built with which ends up seamlessly being included into a final built
application. For example the <code>rand</code> crate can't easily include local JS (perhaps
to detect what API for randomness it's supposed to use) without imposing strong
requirements on the final artifact.</p>
<p>Ergonomically support imports from custom JS files also looks to be required by
frameworks like <code>stdweb</code> to build a macro like <code>js!</code>. This involves generating
snippets of JS at compile time which need to be included into the final bundle,
which is intended to be powered by this new attribute.</p>
<a class="header" href="#stakeholders-1" id="stakeholders-1"><h1>Stakeholders</h1></a>

<li>Bundler (webpack) and <code>wasm-bindgen</code> integration folks.</li>
</ul>

<a class="header" href="#detailed-explanation-3" id="detailed-explanation-3"><h1>Detailed Explanation</h1></a>
<p>This proposal involves a number of moving pieces, all of which are intended to
work in concert to provide a streamlined story to including local JS files into
a final <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> artifact. We'll take a look at each piece at a time
here.</p>
<a class="header" href="#new-syntactical-features" id="new-syntactical-features"><h3>New Syntactical Features</h3></a>
<p>The most user-facing change proposed here is the reinterpretation of the
<code>module</code> attribute inside of <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> and the addition of an
<code>inline_js</code> attribute. They can now be used to import local files and define
local imports like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen(module = &quot;/js/foo.js&quot;)]
extern &quot;C&quot; {
    // ... definitions
}

#[wasm_bindgen(inline_js = &quot;export function foo() {}&quot;)]
extern &quot;C&quot; {
    fn foo();
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The first declaration says that the block of functions and types and such are
all imported from the <code>/js/foo.js</code> file, relative to the current file and rooted
at the crate root. The second declaration lists the JS inline as a string
literal and the <code>extern</code> block describes the exports of the inline module.</p>
<p>The following rules are proposed for interpreting a <code>module</code> attribute.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the strings starts with the platform-specific representation of an absolute
path to the cargo build directory (identified by <code>$OUT_DIR</code>) then the string
is interpreted as a file path in the output directory. This is intended for
build scripts which generate JS files as part of the build.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the string starts with <code>/</code>, <code>./</code>, or <code>../</code> then it's considered a path to a
local file. If not, then it's passed through verbatim as the ES module import.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All paths are resolved relative to the current file, like Rust's own
<code>#[path]</code>, <code>include_str!</code>, etc. At this time, however, it's unknown how we'd
actually do this for relative files. As a result all paths will be required to
start with <code>/</code>. When <code>proc_macro</code> has a stable API (or we otherwise figure
out how) we can start allowing <code>./</code> and <code>../</code>-prefixed paths.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This will hopefully roughly match what programmers expect as well as preexisting
conventions in browsers and bundlers.</p>
<p>The <code>inline_js</code> attribute isn't really intended to be used for general-purpose
development, but rather a way for procedural macros which can't currently today
rely on the presence of <code>$OUT_DIR</code> to generate JS to import.</p>
<a class="header" href="#format-of-imported-js" id="format-of-imported-js"><h3>Format of imported JS</h3></a>
<p>All imported JS is required to written with ES module syntax. Initially the JS
must be hand-written and cannot be postprocessed. For example the JS cannot be
written with TypeScript, nor can it be compiled by Babel or similar.</p>
<p>As an example, a library may contain:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
// src/lib.rs
#[wasm_bindgen(module = &quot;/js/foo.js&quot;)]
extern &quot;C&quot; {
    fn call_js();
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>accompanied with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// js/foo.js

export function call_js() {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>js/foo.js</code> uses ES module syntax to export the function <code>call_js</code>.
When <code>call_js</code> is called from Rust it will call the <code>call_js</code> function in
<code>foo.js</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#propagation-through-dependencies" id="propagation-through-dependencies"><h3>Propagation Through Dependencies</h3></a>
<p>The purpose of the <code>file</code> attribute is to work seamlessly with dependencies.
When building a project with <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> you shouldn't be required to know
whether your dependencies are using local JS snippets or not!</p>
<p>The <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> macro, at compile time, will read the contents of the file
provided, if any. This file will be serialized into the wasm-bindgen custom
sections in a wasm-bindgen specific format. The final wasm artifact produced by
rustc will contain all referenced JS file contents in its custom sections.</p>
<p>The <code>wasm-bindgen</code> CLI tool will extract all this JS and write it out to the
filesystem. The wasm file (or the wasm-bindgen-generated shim JS file) emitted
will import all the emitted JS files with relative imports.</p>
<a class="header" href="#updating-wasm-bindgen-output-modes" id="updating-wasm-bindgen-output-modes"><h3>Updating <code>wasm-bindgen</code> output modes</h3></a>
<p>The <code>wasm-bindgen</code> has a few modes of output generation today. These output
modes are largely centered around modules vs no modules and how modules are
defined. This RFC proposes that we move away from this moreso towards
<em>environments</em>, such as node.js-compatible vs browser-compatible code (which
involves more than only module format). This means that in cases where an
environment supports multiple module systems, or the module system is optional
(browsers support es modules and also no modules) <code>wasm-bindgen</code> will choose
what module system it thinks is best as long as it is compatible with that
environment.</p>
<p>The current output modes of <code>wasm-bindgen</code> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Default</strong> - by default <code>wasm-bindgen</code> emits output that assumes the wasm
module itself is an ES module. This will naturally work with custom JS
snippets that are themselves ES modules, as they'll just be more modules in
the graph all found in the local output directory. This output mode is
currently only consumable by bundlers like Webpack, the default output cannot
be loaded in either a web browser or Node.js.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>--no-modules</code></strong> - the <code>--no-modules</code> flag to <code>wasm-bindgen</code> is incompatible
with ES modules because it's intended to be included via a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag
which is not a module. This mode, like today, will fail to work if upstream
crates contain local JS snippets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>--nodejs</code></strong> - this flag to <code>wasm-bindgen</code> indicates that the output should
be tailored for Node.js, notably using CommonJS module conventions. In this
mode <code>wasm-bindgen</code> will eventually use a JS parser in Rust to rewrite ES
syntax of locally imported JS modules into CommonJS syntax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>--browser</code></strong> - currently this flag is the same as the default output mode
except that the output is tailored slightly for a browser environment (such as
assuming that <code>TextEncoder</code> is ambiently available).</p>
<p>This RFC proposes
repurposing this flag (breaking it) to instead generate an ES module natively
loadable inside the web browser, but otherwise having a similar interface to
<code>--no-modules</code> today, detailed below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This RFC proposes rethinking these output modes as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th> Target Environment      </th><th> CLI Flag    </th><th> Module Format </th><th> User Experience                          </th><th> How are Local JS Snippets Loaded?                                                            </th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td> Node.js without bundler </td><td> <code>--nodejs</code>  </td><td> Common.js     </td><td> <code>require()</code> the main JS glue file        </td><td> Main JS glue file <code>require()</code>s crates' local JS snippets.                                    </td></tr>
<tr><td> Web without bundler     </td><td> <code>--browser</code> </td><td> ES Modules    </td><td> <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> pointing to main JS glue file, using <code>type=module</code> </td><td> <code>import</code> statements cause additional network requests for crates' local snippets.            </td></tr>
<tr><td> Web with bundler        </td><td> none        </td><td> ES Modules    </td><td> <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> pointing to main JS glue file </td><td> Bundler links crates' local snippets into main JS glue file. No additional network requests except for the <code>wasm</code> module itself. </td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>It is notable that browser with and without bundler is almost the same as far
as <code>wasm-bindgen</code> is concerned: the only difference is that if we assume a
bundler, we can rely on the bundler polyfilling wasm-as-ES-module for us.
Note the <code>--browser</code> here is relatively radically different today and as such
would be a breaking change. It's thought that the usage of <code>--browser</code> is small
enough that we can get away with this, but feedback is always welcome on this
point!</p>
<p>The <code>--no-modules</code> flag doesn't really fit any more as the <code>--browser</code> use case
is intended to subsume that. Note that the this RFC proposes only having the
bundler-oriented and browser-oriented modes supporting local JS snippets for
now, while paving a way forward to eventually support local JS snippets in
Node.js. The <code>--no-modules</code> could eventually also be supported in the same
manner as Node.js is (once we're parsing the JS file and rewriting the exports),
but it's proposed here to generally move away from <code>--no-modules</code> towards
<code>--browser</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>--browser</code> output is currently considered to export an initialization
function which, after called and the returned promise is resolved (like
<code>--no-modules</code> today) will cause all exports to work when called. Before the
promise resolves all exports will throw an error when called.</p>
<a class="header" href="#js-files-depending-on-other-js-files" id="js-files-depending-on-other-js-files"><h3>JS files depending on other JS files</h3></a>
<p>One tricky point about this RFC is when a local JS snippet depends on other JS
files. For example your JS might look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// js/foo.js

import { foo } from '@some/npm-package';
import { bar } from './bar.js'

// ...
</code></pre>
<p>As designed above, these imports would not work. It's intended that we
explicitly say this is an initial limitation of this design. We won't support
imports between JS snippets just yet, but we should eventually be able to do so.</p>
<p>In the long run to support <code>--nodejs</code> we'll need some level of ES module parser
for JS. Once we can parse the imports themselves it would be relatively
straightforward for <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code>, during expansion, to load transitively
included files. For example in the file above we'd include <code>./bar.js</code> into the
wasm custom section. In this future world we'd just rewrite <code>./bar.js</code> (if
necessary) when the final output artifact is emitted. Additionally with NPM
package support in <code>wasm-pack</code> and <code>wasm-bindgen</code> (a future goal) we could
validate entries in <code>package.json</code> are present for imports found.</p>
<a class="header" href="#accessing-wasm-memorytable" id="accessing-wasm-memorytable"><h3>Accessing wasm Memory/Table</h3></a>
<p>JS snippets interacting with the wasm module may commonly need to work with the
<code>WebAssembly.Memory</code> and <code>WebAssembly.Table</code> instances associated with the wasm
module. This RFC proposes using the wasm itself to pass along these objects,
like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
// lib.rs

#[wasm_bindgen(module = &quot;/js/local-snippet.js&quot;)]
extern {
    fn take_u8_slice(memory: &amp;JsValue, ptr: u32, len: u32);
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn call_local_snippet() {
    let vec = vec![0,1,2,3,4];
    let mem = wasm_bindgen::memory();
    take_u8_slice(&amp;mem, vec.as_ptr() as usize as u32, vec.len() as u32);
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">// js/local-snippet.js

export function take_u8_slice(memory, ptr, len) {
    let slice = new UInt8Array(memory.arrayBuffer, ptr, len);
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here the <code>wasm_bindgen::memory()</code> existing intrinsic is used to pass along the
memory object to the imported JS snippet. To mirror this we'll add
<code>wasm_bindgen::function_table()</code> as well to the <code>wasm-bindgen</code> crate as an
intrinsic to access the function table and return it as a <code>JsValue</code>.</p>
<p>Eventually we may want a more explicit way to import the memory/table, but for
now this should be sufficient for expressiveness.</p>
<a class="header" href="#drawbacks-2" id="drawbacks-2"><h1>Drawbacks</h1></a>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The initial RFC is fairly conservative. It doesn't work with <code>--nodejs</code> out of
the gate nor <code>--no-modules</code>. Additionally it doesn't support JS snippets
importing other JS initially. Note that all of these are intended to be
supported in the future, it's just thought that it may take more design than
we need at the get-go for now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JS snippets must be written in vanilla ES module JS syntax. Common
preprocessors like TypeScript can't be used. It's unclear how such
preprocessed JS would be imported. It's hoped that JS snippets are small
enough that this isn't too much of a problem. Larger JS snippets can always be
extracted to an NPM package and postprocessed there. Note that it's always
possible for authors to manually run the TypeScript compiler by hand for these
use cases, though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relatively popular <code>--no-modules</code> flag is proposed to be deprecated in
favor of a <code>--browser</code> flag, which itself will have a breaking change relative
to today. It's thought though that <code>--browser</code> is only very rarely used so is
safe to break, and it's also thought that we'll want to avoid breaking
<code>--no-modules</code> as-is today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local JS snippets are required to be written in ES module syntax. This may be
a somewhat opinionated stance, but it's intended to make it easier to add
future features to <code>wasm-bindgen</code> while continuing to work with JS. The ES
module system, however, is the only known official standard throughout the
ecosystem, so it's hoped that this is a clear choice for writing local JS
snippets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#rationale-and-alternatives-3" id="rationale-and-alternatives-3"><h1>Rationale and Alternatives</h1></a>
<p>The primary alternative to this system is a macro like <code>js!</code> from stdweb. This
allows written small snippets of JS code directly in Rust code, and then
<code>wasm-bindgen</code> would have the knowledge to generate appropriate shims. This RFC
proposes recognizing <code>module</code> paths instead of this approach as it's thought to
be a more general approach. Additionally it's intended that the <code>js!</code> macro can
be built on the <code>module</code> directive including local file paths. The
<code>wasm-bindgen</code> crate may grow a <code>js!</code>-like macro one day, but it's thought that
it's best to start with a more conservative approach.</p>
<p>One alternative for ES modules is to simply concatenate all JS together. This
way we wouldn't have to parse anything but we'd instead just throw everything
into one file. The downside of this approach, however, is that it can easily
lead to namespacing conflicts and it also forces everyone to agree on module
formats and runs the risk of forcing the module format of the final product.</p>
<p>Another alternative to emitting small files at wasm-bindgen time is to instead
unpack all files at <em>runtime</em> by leaving them in custom sections of the wasm
executable. This in turn, however, may violate some CSP settings (particularly
strict ones).</p>

<p>In particular I’d love to see a modular effort towards implementing a virtual

<p>Our toolchain already has <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/2018/10/24/multithreading-rust-and-wasm.html">experimental support for multithreading in
Wasm</a>. Browsers are currently shipping <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> and
atomics (the primitives of multithreading for Wasm) behind feature flags, and
they expect to start shipping them enabled by default in 2019.</p>
<p>One of WebAssembly's selling points is the ability to effectively utilize
available hardware. Multithreading extends that story from a single core to
many. While multithreading will be <em>literally possible</em> for both JavaScript and
any compiled-to-Wasm language, Rust's unique ownership system makes it
<em>economically realistic</em>.</p>
<p>There are some technical snags (see the link above for details) that mean we
can't get Rust's standard library's <code>std::thread::*</code> working on Wasm. But it is
still crucial that we have shared implementations of core multithreading
building blocks like thread pools and locks across the ecosystem. In 2019, we
should transform our experimental multithreading support into a production-ready
foundation for multithreading on Wasm, get popular crates like <code>rayon</code> working
on the Web, and cash in on Rust's fearless concurrency.</p>

<p>Debugging is tricky because much of the story is out of this working group's
hands, and depends on both the WebAssembly standardization bodies and the folks
implementing browser developer tools instead. However, there are some concrete
steps we can take to improve debugging:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get <code>println!</code>, <code>dbg!</code>, and friends working out of the box with Wasm. To
achieve this, we will build support for the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-sysroot">WebAssembly reference
sysroot</a> and standard system calls for Wasm that are in the
standardization pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the ability to compile our Rust-generated Wasm to JavaScript with
source maps when debugging. Source maps are a limited debug info format for
JavaScript that enable stepping through source locations in a debugger,
instead of stepping through compiler-generated JavaScript code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add debugging-focused tracing and instrumentation features to our
toolchain. For example, it is currently difficult to debug a JavaScript array
buffer view of Wasm memory getting detached because Wasm memory was
resized. We can make debugging easier by optionally instrumenting <code>mem.grow</code>
instructions with logging.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to that, we should work with the WebAssembly standardization bodies
and browser developer tools makers, and actively participate in the WebAssembly
debugging subcharter to create some movement in the debugging space. By keeping
up the environmental and social pressure and lending a hand where we can, we
will eventually have rich, source-level debugging for Wasm.</p>

<p>We choose to focus our efforts in 2019 where:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>We</em> — the Rust and WebAssembly working group — can build and
ship features. Areas where we aren't potentially blocked by external factors,
such as still-in-progress standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can leverage advantages that are <em>unique to Rust</em> in the WebAssembly
domain.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="#things-we-can-build-and-ship" id="things-we-can-build-and-ship"><h2>Things <em>We</em> can Build and Ship</h2></a>
<p>We don't want our fate in anyone's hands but our own.</p>
<p>The toolkit and toolchain polish work don't involve any external entities that
could slow our progress to a halt. For debugging, where the larger story
involves significant consensus with external groups and standards work, we
explicitly choose to focus on what we can do ourselves to improve our own
debugging story. We do not set ourselves up to block on anything produced by the
WebAssembly community group's debugging subcharter, and we won't wait on browser
vendors to implement new Wasm debugging support in developer tools.</p>
<p>Of the roadmap items, the multithreading story has the most risk: our success in
this domain relies on browsers enabling Wasm's multithreading primitives by
default. However, this seems like a relatively safe bet, since the
multithreading primitives have moved past their most experimental phase, <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=sharedarraybuffer">Chrome
is already shipping them enabled by default, and all other major browsers have
implementations that just aren't enabled by default yet.</a></p>
<a class="header" href="#leveraging-unique-advantages" id="leveraging-unique-advantages"><h2>Leveraging Unique Advantages</h2></a>
<p>We want to focus our efforts where we get the biggest effort to impact
efficiency, and establish ourselves as leaders in WebAssembly in ways that no
one else even has a route towards catching up.</p>
<p>The multithreading story is perhaps the biggest example of unique advantage:
multithreading is <em>infamously</em> bug prone (to say the least!) and Rust's
ownership system eliminates data races at compile time.</p>
<p>By building a modular toolkit of libraries, we bolster our ability to target the
full spectrum from tiny module surgically inserted into an existing JavaScript
application, to building a complete Web application in Rust. Any language that
relies on a garbage collector, fat runtime, or is overly opinionated about FFI
and interaction with the outside world can't reach the tiny module end of that
spectrum.</p>
<p>The toolchain polish and debugging work have less clearly <em>unique</em>
advantages. But both are table stakes for a good development experience, and the
par for the course for these things in the Wasm domain is currently so low that
we can and should stand out from the crowd.</p>
<a class="header" href="#considered-alternative-roadmap-items" id="considered-alternative-roadmap-items"><h2>Considered Alternative Roadmap Items</h2></a>
<p>Here are a few alternative items that were considered for the roadmap, perhaps
because they were called out in <code>#RustWasm2019</code> posts, but ultimately were not
included.</p>
<a class="header" href="#pushing-anyref-integration-into-the-rust-language" id="pushing-anyref-integration-into-the-rust-language"><h3>Pushing <code>anyref</code> Integration into the Rust Language</h3></a>
<p>We've already been well positioned to take advantage of host bindings and GC
reference types once they ship in Wasm via <code>wasm-bindgen</code>. We could take it even
further and imagine a future where the Rust language was able to pass around
opaque references to objects in alternative memory spaces (some of which might
be GC'd) in a first class way: structs that are split across memory spaces, fat
pointers into multiple memory spaces, etc.</p>
<p>However, it isn't clear that pushing this all the way into the language will
bring that much utility over the existing <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/pull/1002">&quot;<code>anyref</code> at the edges&quot;
implementation that <code>wasm-bindgen</code> already has.</a>
Additionally, cashing in on this work could easily be blocked in a couple ways:
<code>anyref</code> isn't shipping in any mainstream wasm engine yet, and getting this
language-level integration through the larger Rust RFC process with all of its
stakeholders would happen at a glacial pace (if it even happened!)</p>
<a class="header" href="#a-focus-only-on-pure-rust-web-applications" id="a-focus-only-on-pure-rust-web-applications"><h3>A Focus Only on Pure-Rust Web Applications</h3></a>
<p>We prefer to answer &quot;yes and&quot; to pure-Rust Web applications via the modular
toolkit that can service the full spectrum of tiny module to whole Web app, than
to focus only on the whole Web app end of the spectrum. Our hope with the
toolkit is that a rising tide will lift all boats, regardless where your project
lands on that spectrum.</p>
<p>Additionally, full Web apps are not a <em>unique</em> advantage for Rust. JavaScript
has been doing it for a while, and as far as Wasm goes, there are better-funded
&quot;competitors&quot; in the space that will be able to provide a more compelling
monolithic Web app development experience more quickly (via integration with
tooling, existing ecosystems, or throwing money and developers at the
problem). Microsoft and Blazor, Google and Go, bringing existing native
applications to the Web with Emscripten, etc. We should compete where we are
best positioned to do so, and monolithic Web applications is not that.</p>
<p>All that said, if you want to build a whole Web application with Rust-generated
Wasm and don't want to write any JavaScript at all, you should be able to do
so. In fact, <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/tree/master/examples/no_modules">you already can with <code>#[wasm_bindgen(start)]</code> and the <code>no-modules</code>
target</a>. We will never remove this ability, and the new toolkit will
only make developing a whole Web app easier.</p>
<a class="header" href="#non-javascript-and-non-web-embeddings" id="non-javascript-and-non-web-embeddings"><h3>Non-JavaScript and Non-Web Embeddings</h3></a>
<p>While the whole of every non-Web and non-JavaScript WebAssembly embeddings looks
very exciting, each embedding is a unique environment, and there is not yet a
standard set of capabilities available. We don't want to block on waiting for a
full set of standard capabilities to emerge, nor do we want to choose one
particular embedding environment.</p>
<p>We do intend to support the reference sysroot work, and any follow up work that
comes after it, but we will take advantage of these things on a opportunistic
basis rather than making it a roadmap item.</p>
<p>We encourage anyone interested in non-JavaScript and non-Web embeddings to
collaborate with the WebAssembly community group to push this story forward by
defining standard Wasm capabilities!</p>

<p>The primary goal of <code>wasm-bindgen</code> and <code>wasm-pack</code> is to enable seamless
integration of Rust with JS. A massive portion of the JS ecosystem, npm, however
currently has little support in <code>wasm-bindgen</code> and <code>wasm-pack</code>, making it
difficult to access this rich resource that JS offers!</p>
<p>The goal of this RFC is to enable these dependencies to exist. Rust crates
should be able to require functionality from NPM, just like how NPM can require
Rust crates compiled to wasm. Any workflow which currently uses NPM packages
(such as packaging WebAssembly with a bundler) should continue to work but also
allow pulling in &quot;custom&quot; NPM packages as well as requested by Rust
dependencies.</p>
<a class="header" href="#stakeholders-2" id="stakeholders-2"><h1>Stakeholders</h1></a>
<p>This RFC primarily affects uses of <code>wasm-pack</code> and <code>wasm-bindgen</code> who are also
currently using bundlers like Webpack. This also affects, however, developers of
core foundational crates in the Rust ecosystem who want to be concious of the
ability to pull in NPM dependencies and such.</p>
<a class="header" href="#detailed-explanation-5" id="detailed-explanation-5"><h1>Detailed Explanation</h1></a>
<p>Adding an NPM dependency to a Rust project will look very similar to adding an
NPM dependency to a normal JS project. First the dependency, and its version
requirement, need to be declare. This RFC proposes doing this in a
<code>package.json</code> file adjacent to the crate's <code>Cargo.toml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json"> {
  &quot;dependencies&quot;: {
    &quot;foo&quot;: &quot;^1.0.1&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>package.json</code> file will initially be a subset of NPM's <code>package.json</code>,
only supporting one <code>dependencies</code> top-level key which internally has key/value
pairs with strings. Beyond this validation though no validation will be
performed of either key or value pairs within <code>dependencies</code>. In the future
it's intended that more keys of <code>package.json</code> in NPM will be supported, but
this RFC is intended to be an MVP for now to enable dependencies on NPM at all.</p>
<p>After this <code>package.json</code> file is created, the package next needs to be
imported in the Rust crate. Like with other Rust dependencies on JS, this will
be done with the <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> attribute:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen(module = &quot;foo&quot;)]
extern &quot;C&quot; {
    fn function_in_foo_package();
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: in JS the above import would be similar to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { function_in_foo_package } from &quot;foo&quot;;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The exiting <code>module</code> key in the <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> attribute can be used to
indicate which ES module the import is coming from. This affects the <code>module</code>
key in the final output wasm binary, and corresponds to the name of the package
in <code>package.json</code>. This is intended to match how bundler conventions already
interpret NPM packages as ES modules.</p>
<p>After these two tools are in place, all that's needed is a <code>wasm-pack build</code> and
you should be good to go! The final <code>package.json</code> will have the <code>foo</code>
dependency listed in our <code>package.json</code> above and be ready for consumption via a
bundler.</p>
<a class="header" href="#technical-implementation" id="technical-implementation"><h3>Technical Implementation</h3></a>
<p>Under the hood there's a few moving parts which enables all of this to happen.
Let's first take a look at the pieces in <code>wasm-bindgen</code>.</p>
<p>The primary goal of this RFC is to enable <em>tranparent</em> and <em>transitive</em>
dependencies on NPM. The <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> macro is the only aspect of a crate's
build which has access to all transitive dependencies, so this is what we'll be
using to slurp up <code>package.json</code>. When <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> with a <code>module</code> key is
specified it will look for <code>package.json</code> inside the cwd of the procedural macro
(note that the cwd is set by Cargo to be the directory with the crate's
<code>Cargo.toml</code> that is being compiled, or the crate in which <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> is
written). This <code>package.json</code>, if found, will have an absolute path to it
encoded into the custom section that <code>wasm-bindgen</code> already emits.</p>
<p>Later, when the <code>wasm-bindgen</code> CLI tool executes, it will parse an interpret all
items in the wasm-bindgen custom section. All <code>package.json</code> files listed will
be loaded, parsed, and validated (aka only <code>dependencies</code> allowed for now). If
any <code>package.json</code> is loaded then a <code>package.json</code> file will be emitted next to
the output JS file inside of <code>--out-dir</code>.</p>
<p>After <code>wasm-bindgen</code> executes, then <code>wasm-pack</code> will read the <code>package.json</code>
output, if any, and augment it with metadata and other items which are already
emitted.</p>
<p>If more than one crate in a dependency graph depends on an NPM package then in
this MVP proposal an error will be generated. In the future we can implement
some degree of merging version requirements, but for now to remain simple
<code>wasm-bindgen</code> will emit an error.</p>
<a class="header" href="#interaction-with---no-modules" id="interaction-with---no-modules"><h3>Interaction with <code>--no-modules</code></h3></a>
<p>Depending on NPM packages fundamentally requires, well, NPM, in one way or
another. The <code>wasm-bindgen</code> and <code>wasm-pack</code> CLI tools have modes of output
(notably <code>wasm-bindgen</code>'s <code>--no-modules</code> and <code>wasm-pack</code>'s <code>--target no-modules</code>
flags) which are intended to not require NPM and other JS tooling. In these
situations if a <code>package.json</code> in any Rust crate is detected an error will be
emitted indicating so.</p>
<p>Note that this means that core crates which are intended to work with
<code>--no-modules</code> will not be able add NPM dependencies. Instead they'll have to
either import Rust dependencies from crates.io or use a feature like <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/rfcs/pull/6">local JS
snippets</a> to import custom JS code.</p>
<a class="header" href="#drawbacks-3" id="drawbacks-3"><h1>Drawbacks</h1></a>
<p>One of the primary drawbacks of this RFC is that it's fundamentally incompatible
with a major use case of <code>wasm-bindgen</code> and <code>wasm-pack</code>, the <code>--no-modules</code> and
<code>--target no-modules</code> flags. As a short-term band-aid this RFC proposes making
it a hard error which would hinder the adoption of this feature in crates that
want to be usable in this mode.</p>
<p>In the long-term, however, it may be possible to get this working. For example
many NPM packages are available on <code>unpkg.com</code> or in other locations. It may be
possible, if all packages in these locations adhere to well-known conventions,
to generate code that's compatible with these locations of hosting NPM packages.
In these situations it may then be possible to &quot;just drop a script tag&quot; in a few
locations to get <code>--no-modules</code> working with NPM packages. It's unclear how
viable this is, though.</p>
<a class="header" href="#rationale-and-alternatives-4" id="rationale-and-alternatives-4"><h1>Rationale and Alternatives</h1></a>
<p>When developing this RFC, some guiding values for its design have been
articulated:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Development on Rust-generated WebAssembly projects should allow developers to
use the development environment they are most comfortable with. Developers
writing Rust should get to use Rust, and developers using JavaScript should
get to use a JS based runtime environment (Node.js, Chakra, etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JavaScript tooling and workflows should be usable with Rust-generated
WebAssembly projects. For example, bundlers like WebPack and Parcel, or
dependency management tools such as <code>npm audit</code> and GreenKeeper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When possible, decisions should be made that allow the solution to be
available to developers of not just Rust, but also C, and C++.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decisions should be focused on creating workflows that allow developers an
easy learning curve and productive development experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These principles lead to the above proposal of using <code>package.json</code> to declare
NPM dependencies which is then grouped together by <code>wasm-bindgen</code> to be
published by <code>wasm-pack</code>. By using <code>package.json</code> we get inherent compatibility
with existing workflows like GreenKeeper and <code>npm install</code>. Additionally
<code>package.json</code> is very well documented and supported throughout the JS ecosystem
making it very familiar.</p>
<p>Some other alternatives to this RFC which have been ruled out are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Using <code>Cargo.toml</code> instead of <code>package.json</code></strong> to declare NPM dependencies.
For example we could use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package.metadata.npm.dependencies]
foo = &quot;0.1&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This has the drawback though of being incompatible with all existing workflows
around <code>package.json</code>. Additionally it also highlights a discrepancy between
NPM and Cargo and how <code>&quot;0.1&quot;</code> as a version requirement is interpreted (e.g.
<code>^0.1</code> or <code>~0.1</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adding a separate manifest file</strong> instead of using <code>package.json</code> is also
possibility and might be easier for <code>wasm-bindgen</code> to read and later
parse/include. This has a possible benefit of being scoped to exactly our use
case and not being misleading by disallowing otherwise-valid fields of
<code>package.json</code>. The downside of this approach is the same as <code>Cargo.toml</code>,
however, in that it's an unfamiliar format to most and is incompatible with
existing tooling without bringing too much benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Annotating version dependencies inline</strong> could be used rather than
<code>package.json</code> as well, such as:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[wasm_bindgen(module = &quot;foo&quot;, version = &quot;0.1&quot;)]
extern &quot;C&quot; {
    // ...
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>As with all other alternatives this is incompatible with existing tooling, but
it's also not aligned with Rust's own mechanism for declaring dependencies
which separates the location for version information and the code iteslf.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#unresolved-questions-5" id="unresolved-questions-5"><h1>Unresolved Questions</h1></a>
<ul>
<li>Is the MVP restriction of only using <code>dependencies</code> too limiting? Should more
fields be supported in <code>package.json</code>?</li>
